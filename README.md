# Typegen Editor Plugins

This repository hosts editor plugins for Typegen, a schema definition language that acts as a middleman between different programming languages. For more information about Typegen itself, its syntax, and its capabilities, please refer to the official [repository](https://github.com/cakeruu/typegen).

## Currently Supported Editors

- Visual Studio Code

## Vision

While the initial focus has been on Visual Studio Code, the long-term vision is to support a wider range of editors. We aim to provide a consistent and powerful feature set for Typegen users, regardless of their preferred development environment.

Contributions for new editor plugins or improvements to existing ones are highly encouraged!
